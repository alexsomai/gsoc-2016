## <a name="main-project"></a>Main project - External Workspace Manager Plugin

The main project that I have worked on during [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2016
is called External Workspace Manager Plugin.
The complete documentation that I have written may be found
[here](https://github.com/jenkinsci/external-workspace-manager-plugin/blob/master/README.md).

During the community bonding period I have created a plugin design document.
The document was also updated on the go, as I was progressing with the code.
It is publicly shared via Google Docs: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yiisnsR7qg3XEEvch8vocWbitSUCZcoQ-pfzEVFg1eA/edit?usp=sharing>

I have tracked my progress using JIRA.
The EPICs are:

* Coding period phase 1: [JENKINS-35019](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-35019)
* Coding period phase 2: [JENKINS-35971](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-35971)

The plugin's source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/jenkinsci/external-workspace-manager-plugin).
Following are the links to the list of **commits** I have made on this project:

## <a name="blog-posts"></a>Blog posts @ jenkins.io

During the GSoC I have also submitted several blog posts on the Jenkins blogging page:

* The introductory blog post: <https://jenkins.io/blog/2016/05/23/external-workspace-manager-plugin/>
* The blog post announcing the alpha release: <https://jenkins.io/blog/2016/06/30/ewm-alpha-version/>

The blog posts were submitted via pull request: [#254](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/254),
[#296](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/296).
I have also made some other minor **contributions** to the
[jenkins.io](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io) repository:

## <a name="related-projects"></a>Related projects

My project is dependant, more or less, on other plugins.
Therefore, I have contributed to other Jenkins plugins too.

### <a name="run-selector-plugin"></a>Run Selector Plugin

In the External Workspace Manager Plugin I needed a feature to select a specific build based on some input parameters.
Such feature was available in the [Copy Artifact Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin).
But, my mentors and I have decided that it would be better for the community to isolate the build selection logic
in a separate plugin, so that, in the future other plugins may benefit from this functionality.
I have started a discussion about this on the Jenkins dev ML:
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/G-ZnJu3h67g>.

The work I did to decouple the build selection logic is in the
[Run Selector Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/run-selector-plugin).
The **commits** are:

* Page 1: <https://github.com/jenkinsci/run-selector-plugin/commits/master?author=alexsomai&page=1>
* Page 2: <https://github.com/jenkinsci/run-selector-plugin/commits/master?author=alexsomai&page=2>

[//]:TODO - not released yet, but hopefully it will be
[//]:I have also released the Run Selector Plugin.
[//]:Minimum version 1.0 is needed to be used by the External Workspace Manager Plugin.

### <a name="workspace-cleanup-plugin"></a>Workspace Cleanup Plugin

The External Workspace Manager Plugin needed a workspace cleanup feature, so that the user may automatically delete
the workspace after it was used.
The [Workspace Cleanup Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ws-cleanup-plugin) does that,
but it was not Pipeline compatible.
Since my project is mainly focused on Pipeline jobs, I had to make the Workspace Cleanup Plugin to be
Pipeline compatible.
There was an existing issue related to that, too:
[JENKINS-28454](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-28454).
The Pipeline compatibility pull request
[#27](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ws-cleanup-plugin/pull/27) that I submitted was merged, and the afferent
**commits** are:

* <https://github.com/jenkinsci/ws-cleanup-plugin/commits/master?author=alexsomai>

The Workspace Cleanup Plugin was released with my changes.
Since version 0.30 it is compatible with my project, External Workspace Manager Plugin.

## <a name="acceptance-test-harness"></a>Acceptance Test Harness

I have written Acceptance Tests for the External Workspace Manager Plugin.
These tests are located in a separate [repository](https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness),
and are meant to test the integration with other plugins.
For this, I have created the PR [#172](https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/pull/172).

[//]:TODO - not merged yet
[//]:It was merged, and the commits are:
