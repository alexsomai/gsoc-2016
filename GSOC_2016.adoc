## Related projects

My project is dependant, more or less, on other plugins.
Therefore, I have contributed to other Jenkins plugins too.

### Run Selector Plugin

In the External Workspace Manager Plugin I needed a feature to select a specific build based on some input parameters.
Such feature was available in the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin[Copy Artifact Plugin].
But, my mentors and I have decided that it would be better for the community to isolate the build selection logic
in a separate plugin, so that, in the future other plugins may benefit from this functionality.
I have started a discussion about this on the Jenkins dev ML:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/G-ZnJu3h67g.

The work I did to decouple the build selection logic is in the
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/run-selector-plugin[Run Selector Plugin].

### Workspace Cleanup Plugin

The External Workspace Manager Plugin needed a workspace cleanup feature, so that the user may automatically delete
the workspace after it was used.
The link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/ws-cleanup-plugin[Workspace Cleanup Plugin] does that,
but it was not Pipeline compatible.
Since my project is mainly focused on Pipeline jobs, I had to make the Workspace Cleanup Plugin to be
Pipeline compatible. Also there was an issue related to that:
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-28454[JENKINS-28454].
I have submitted a Pipeline compatibility
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/ws-cleanup-plugin/pull/27[pull request], which was merged, and the afferent
commits are:
